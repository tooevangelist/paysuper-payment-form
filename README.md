### Development
The package requires `paysuper-dashboard` backend to be served first (`yarn serve:be` to run).

`http://localhost:8080/order` page. It's provided by `paysuper-dashboard` backend

#### Modal view
Add `modal=true` into request url to run the form in modal view mode:
`http://localhost:8080/order?modal=true`

#### Dev data preset
Add `devPreset=1` into request url to use default development data preset 
(project + products combination): `http://localhost:8080/order?devPreset=1`

### Production
Define mounting place with id `paysuper-payment-form` and attach the form script library
```html
<div id="paysuper-payment-form"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.pay.super.com/payform/latest/paysuper-form.js"></script>
