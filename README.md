## Demo

Try out [the payment sample](https://dashboard.pay.super.com/form-demo) for a [Simple Checkout](https://docs.pay.super.com/docs/payments/#simple-checkout) and a [Products Checkout](https://docs.pay.super.com/docs/payments/#products-checkout).

## Usage

Do not use this module directly, use [paysuper-js-sdk](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-js-sdk) instead. PaySuper JS SDK is designed to integrate a [PaySuper Payment Form](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-payment-form) on your website or a game client.

## Developing

The package requires [Paysuper Dashboard](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-management-api) backend to be served first:

```bash
yarn serve:be
```

The form runs on `http://localhost:4040/` where you will be redirected to 
`http://localhost:8080/order` page. It's provided by [Paysuper Dashboard](https://github.com/paysuper/paysuper-management-api) backend.

#### Modal view

Add `modal=true` as a query parameter in the request URL to run the form in a modal view mode:

```http
http://localhost:8080/order?modal=true
```

#### Dev data preset

Add `devPreset=1` as a query parameter in the request URL to use a default development data preset (project + products combination): 

```http
http://localhost:8080/order?devPreset=1
```

### Branches

We use the [GitFlow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model) as a branching model for Git.
